## Key Findings

| Category                      | Finding                                                |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Least Privilege           | Not implemented – full access granted to all users   |
| Encryption                | Missing – credit card & customer data unprotected     |
| Backups / Recovery        | Not in place – no recovery or backup system          |
| Password Management     | Weak policy, lacks enforcement & centralized control  |
| Technical Controls        | Firewall and antivirus present, IDS missing         |
| Compliance                | Gaps in PCI DSS & SOC; Partial GDPR compliance     |
